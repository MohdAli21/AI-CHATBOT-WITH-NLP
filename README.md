# ***AI Chatbot with NLP – Project Overview*** 

#### **Introduction**  
The **AI Chatbot with NLP** is a chatbot designed to interact with users by answering queries, providing weather updates, fetching news, solving mathematical expressions, and telling programming-related jokes. The project integrates **Natural Language Processing (NLP), API handling, and Python programming** to create an interactive assistant.  

---

### **Tools and Technologies Used**  

1. **Programming Language:**  
   - Implemented in **Python**, a versatile language widely used for **machine learning, data science, and automation**.  

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Library:**  
   - **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):**  
     - The chatbot utilizes the `nltk.chat.util.Chat` class to process and respond to user queries.  
     - The `reflections` dictionary helps handle variations in user input for better responses.  

3. **APIs Used:**  
   - **OpenWeatherMap API:**  
     - Retrieves real-time weather updates based on the user's city input.  
     - Provides weather conditions such as temperature and atmospheric details.  
   - **NewsAPI:**  
     - Fetches the latest global news headlines.  
     - A random selection of articles ensures variety in responses.  

4. **Mathematical Computation Library:**  
   - **SymPy:**  
     - Used to solve mathematical expressions dynamically.  
     - Converts user-inputted math problems into solvable equations.  

5. **Randomization Module:**  
   - **Random Library:**  
     - Used to randomly select **news headlines and jokes** from predefined lists.  

6. **Editor & Development Environment:**  
   - **VS Code (Visual Studio Code):**  
     - The chatbot is developed and tested in **VS Code**, an advanced **IDE** with excellent debugging and extension support for Python.  
   - **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**  
     - The chatbot runs in a **terminal-based environment**, making it easy to interact with users in real time.

### **How It Works**  

1. **User Interaction:**  
   - The chatbot begins by greeting the user.  
   - It waits for input and processes the request using predefined patterns.  

2. **Handling Queries:**  
   - **Basic Conversations:** Responds to greetings and simple queries like "What is your name?"  
   - **Weather Updates:** If the user asks about the weather, the chatbot prompts for a city name and fetches real-time data using the OpenWeatherMap API.  
   - **News Updates:** Retrieves the latest news articles from NewsAPI and presents a random selection of headlines.  
   - **Math Solving:** If the user inputs a math expression with “solve,” the chatbot computes the result using SymPy.  
   - **Jokes:** If prompted, the chatbot tells a random programming-related joke.  

3. **Termination:**  
   - The chatbot continues running until the user types `"bye"` or `"goodbye"`, at which point it ends the conversation.
